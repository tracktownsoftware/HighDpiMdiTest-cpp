To show this bug I had to enable DPI_AWARENESS_CONTEXT_PER_MONITOR_AWARE_V2. I did this by
1) Set DPI Awareness to None in project "Properties | Configuration Properties | Manifest Tool Input and Output | DPI Awareness"
2) Added this code to mdi.cpp:  SetProcessDpiAwarenessContext(DPI_AWARENESS_CONTEXT_PER_MONITOR_AWARE_V2);

To see the bug:
1) Set display to 100%
2) Run the app and display a Child MDI using "File|New Bounce" or "File|New Hello"
3) Maximize the child window
4) Leave the app running and change the display to a GREATER value: If step 1 was 100% then set to 175% or greater
5) The maximized MDI child window no longer fills the MDI parent accurately.
